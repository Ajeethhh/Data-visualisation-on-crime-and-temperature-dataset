# Data-visualisation-on-crime-and-temperature-dataset
The project aims to provide a comprehensive data visualization and analysis of policing and weather data in Colchester for the year 2023. Various visualization techniques, including tables, bar plots, pie charts, density plots, box plots, scatter plots, and time series plots, are employed. Additionally, interactive graphics are also used to enhance the user experience and enable deeper exploration of the data. So, Iâ€™ve decided to combine both data sets and seek to understand the relationship between crime incidents and weather factors, identify any seasonal patterns or trends, and provide actionable insights for law enforcement agencies and policymakers.  Let's delve into the details of each visualization and uncover the story hidden within the data.
We've imported two datasets: crime data and weather data for 2023. To align the date formats, we adjusted the weather dataset to include only month and year, matching the crime data. After confirming the modification and renaming the date column.First, we're checking for missing values in the datasets to ensure data quality. Then, we're removing irrelevant columns from both datasets as they won't contribute to our analysis.This preprocessing prepares our datasets for visualization and analysis.
